<h2 id="install">&raquo; Install HESK</h2>

<div class="error">
<p style="font-weight:bold">Please take 5 minutes to read the installation instructions carefully and thoroughly! Doing so will ensure a proper and easy installation.</p>
</div>

&nbsp;

<div class="notice">
<p>Before installing HESK, you will need to obtain your MySQL database information, such as <b>database name</b>, <b>user</b>, and <b>password</b>.
You need to get this information from your HOSTING COMPANY; HESK cannot help you find it.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;<br /><span class="tip">TIP:</span> Want a hassle-free help desk working in minutes? Sign up for <a href="https://www.hesk.com/remote-help-desk.php"><b>HESK Cloud</b></a> instead.<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Installation steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Connect with FTP to the <i>public folder</i> of your server where the rest of your Web site is.</p>
<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> The public folder is usually called &quot;<b>public_html</b>&quot;, &quot;www&quot;, &quot;site&quot; or &quot;htdocs&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> Learn how to FTP files by reading this <a href="https://www.phpjunkyard.com/tutorials/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php">FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new folder where you will install HESK. Name it anything you like, for example, &quot;helpdesk&quot; or &quot;support&quot;.<br />
Example: /public_html/helpdesk<br />
Corresponding URL: https://www.example.com/helpdesk</p></li>
<li><p>Upload all HESK files to your server. PHP files must be transferred in ASCII mode and images in BINARY mode.</p>
<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> Most FTP clients will automatically select the proper transfer mode, so you needn't worry about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <b>hesk/install</b> in your browser, for example (modify to your URL):<br />
https://www.example.com/helpdesk/install</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HESK setup script will run. Click <b>INSTALL HESK</b> and follow instructions through 4 steps:</p>
   <ul>
   <li><b>STEP 1: License agreement</b> - read the HESK License agreement and confirm that you agree with the terms.</li>
   <li><b>STEP 2: Check setup</b> - the script will test your server to see if all required settings are correct and advise solutions to any problems.</li>
   <li><b>STEP 3: Database settings</b> - enter your MySQL database settings, and the setup script will test them.<br />
       <span class="dest">You need to get the correct MySQL database information from your hosting company!</span></li>
   <li><b>STEP 4: Setup database tables</b> - everything OK; the script will install MySQL tables.<br />&nbsp;</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Before closing the installation script, <span class="dest">DELETE the &quot;install&quot; directory from your server!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done, now it's time to set up your help desk! Click the Continue link in the install script or open the <b>admin</b> folder in your browser, for example:<br />
https://www.example.com/helpdesk/admin/</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> HESK passwords are CaSe SeNSiTiVe (&quot;ABCD&quot; is not the same as &quot;abcd&quot;) while usernames are not.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Click the <b>Settings</b> link in the top menu to get to the settings page (if not there already)</p></li>

<li>
<p>Take some time and get familiar with all the available settings. Most should be self-explanatory; for additional information
about each setting, click the [<a href="Javascript:void(0)"><b>?</b></a>] link for help about the current setting.</p>
<p>Don't forget to click the <b>Save changes</b> button at the bottom of the settings page to save your settings!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Things to do next</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Click the &quot;Profile&quot; link to set your name, e-mail, signature, and password.</p></li>

<li><p>Add new categories (departments) on the &quot;Categories&quot; page. You cannot delete the default category, but you can rename it.</p></li>

<li><p>To create additional staff accounts, visit the &quot;Team&quot; page. You cannot delete the default user (Administrator), but you can change the username.</p></li>

<li><p>You can create canned responses on the &quot;Canned&quot; page. These are pre-written replies to common support questions.</p></li>

<li><p>To access and manage your knowledgebase, click the &quot;Knowledgebase&quot; link.</p>

<p>The knowledgebase is a collection of answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) and articles which provide self-help resources to your customers. You can arrange articles into categories and subcategories.</p>

<p>A comprehensive and well-written knowledgebase can drastically reduce the number of support tickets you receive and save a lot of your time.</p></li>

<b>https://www.example.com/helpdesk</b></p></li>

<h2 id="upgrade">&raquo; Upgrading from old versions</h2>

<div class="error">
<p style="font-weight:bold">Please take 5 minutes to read the installation instructions carefully and thoroughly! Doing so will ensure a proper and easy installation.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Known upgrade issues</b></p>

<ul>
<li>HESK language will be reset to English if new text was added.</li>
<li>When upgrading from very old versions, you might need to <a href="https://www.hesk.com/knowledgebase/?article=22">reset your password</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> Perform the upgrade in low-traffic hours when your Web site receives the least amount of visits.</p>

<div class="notice">
<p>Your existing HESK files are contained in a single directory on your server. You will be replacing most of the contents of this directory with the contents of the folder you downloaded containing the new version of HESK.</p>
</div>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Upgrade steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="dest" style="font-weight:bold">BACKUP YOUR EXISTING HESK DATABASE AND FILES</span><br />... or don't blame me if something goes wrong.</p>
<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> Most hosting companies allow you to backup files and databases from the web hosting control panel. Contact your host if not sure how to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload and place all of the new HESK files you downloaded into your existing HESK directory on your server <b>EXCEPT</b> these (do NOT upload these files):<br />
- hesk_settings.inc.php<br />
- head.txt<br />
- header.txt<br />
- footer.txt</p>

<p>Your HESK directory now contains the updated files you require for updating your copy of HESK.</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> You must transfer images in BINARY and all other files in ASCII mode. Most FTP clients will automatically select the proper transfer mode, so you needn't worry about it.</p>

<div class="notice">
<p><b>Did you rename your HESK's <i>/admin</i> folder?</b> If yes, don't forget to move files from the new version's <i>/admin</i> folder into your renamed folder.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<p>Open <b>hesk/install</b> in your browser, for example:<br />
https://www.example.com/helpdesk/install</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HESK setup script will show up on the install URL. Click <b>UPDATE HESK</b> and follow instructions. The update consists of 4 steps:</p>
   <ul>
   <li><b>STEP 1: License agreement</b> - read the HESK License agreement and confirm that you agree with the terms.</li>
   <li><b>STEP 2: Check setup</b> - the script will test your server to see if all required settings are correct and advise solutions to any problems.</li>
   <li><b>STEP 3: Database settings</b> - check your MySQL database settings, and the script will test them.<br />
       <span class="dest">The settings must be the same as with your old HESK installation</span></li>
   <li><b>STEP 4: Update database tables</b> - everything OK; the script will update existing MySQL tables.<br />&nbsp;</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Before closing the upgrade script, <span class="dest">DELETE the &quot;install&quot; directory on your server!</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the admin panel (https://www.example.com/helpdesk/admin) and log in with your username. If your password doesn't work anymore, <a href="https://www.hesk.com/knowledgebase/?article=22">reset it</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test HESK to make sure the upgrade was successful and everything works. You may need to modify your Help Desk title and Custom field settings if they are not displaying correctly.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If you own a HESK license, you might need to <a href="https://www.hesk.com/license">download a new one</a>.</p>
<p>If not, consider supporting HESK by <a href="https://www.hesk.com/buy.php">purchasing a license</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Good luck with using HESK!<br />&nbsp;</p></li>
