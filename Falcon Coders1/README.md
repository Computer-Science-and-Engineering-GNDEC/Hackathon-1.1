## FAQ Section:
- It consists of Frequently Asked Questions that can be put up by Admin or HOD's by using Website module very easily.

## Desk:
After Login, only teachers and HOD's can access some specific modules related to their fields as we have set permission in this way. They can keep record of their courses, schedule, programmes, etc.

## Queries: 
In support module, at issues, HOD's can see the queries that are being entered by students and they can assign the task to solve the queries to some other person also.
User permissions can be set accordingly so that particular query would be visible to particular person only.
